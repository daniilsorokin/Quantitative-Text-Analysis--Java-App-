This is a Java application with a GUI to anaylise a single document and extract most relevant keywords. It implements a Tf/Idf approximation that uses corpus statistics instead of the Idf component to normalize document frequencies.

It requires [TreeTagger](http://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/TreeTagger/) in order to collect information about lemmas from a document. You have to download and install TreeTagger yourself. After installation specify the TreeTagger location in the qta.conf file.
